# Components-Analysis-Tool
Training application for conducting Kernel/Principle Components Analysis with full-featured project lifecycle support

The only purpose for me to create that application was to practise implementing fully-functional working project lifecycle support (creation, save/reopen, content import/export, etc.) The program's UI is WinForms-based. English/Russian localization is present as well.
