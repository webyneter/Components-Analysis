# Components-Analysis
Training application for conducting Kernel/Principle Components Analysis with project lifecycle support

The only purpose for me to create that application was to practise **implementing** working project lifecycle support (creation, save/reopen, content import/export, etc.) The program's UI is WinForms-based. English/Russian localization is present as well. Third-party solutions such as [Accord](http://accord-framework.net/), [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/) frameworks, etc. used extensively.
